## 🔧 Setting Up Your Local Development Environment

Data Nadhi uses **Dev Containers**, which provide a fully-configured environment for development.  

1. **Open in VS Code:**  
   - Install the [Remote - Containers extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).  
   - Open the repository in VS Code. You’ll be prompted to “Reopen in Container.”  

2. **Inside the Container:**  
   - All dependencies are pre-installed.  
   - Start the server, or make changes directly without worrying about your local setup.  

*Using Dev Containers ensures consistency across contributors and reduces setup friction.*
